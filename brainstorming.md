## Final App Idea Chosen 

After careful evaluation, I have chosen **Idea 2: LetsCook App** as our final app concept. 
I believe it offers a unique value proposition by combining recipe search, cooking procedures, and AI-powered recipe assistance, making 
it a valuable tool for home cooks. Our team is excited to work on this project.

In addition, I do have some experience with openAI api, and I believe the concepts taught in CodePath would be sufficient enough for me to execute this app.
If I come across any concepts not taught in CodePath, I will either make the scope smaller, or would get help from CodePath instructor.
